Most other online chart software deals only with two dimensional data, that is, its basic data types are pairs of x and y values. This project on the other hand stores its data in multiple dimensions, often called a data space. This leaves further room for expansion to, for example, project multidimensional dataset in two or three dimensions. Labels and hierarchical categories---or groupings---are described as meta-data.

var data = 
[
	[10, 30, 2001],
	[20, 45, 2001],
	[13, 23, 2002],
	[12, 60, 2002]
];


Nominal Comparison
var data = {
	options: {
		title: 'Employee turnover'
	},	
	meta: [
		['IT'],
		['R&D'],
		['Sales'],
		['Support']		
	],
	data: [
		[12],
		[6],
		[18],
		[24]
	]
};
