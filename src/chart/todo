-look into labels for numeric axes
-implement preferred size for all components.
-implement insets for all components
-reduce code duplication in axis drawing code.
-move canvas beginViewport/endViewport outside of axes drawing code
-implement polar axes.
-add legend
-test composite chart
+fixed category axis with numbers
+added colors from default to canvas
+fixed category axes with opposite axis not starting at zero (labels were hanging, which might be inconvenient).
+fixed long labels (all labels have equal size per axis, and the size is the maximum of the individual labels).
+fixed aspect ratio
+added draw grid options for canvas
+changed fill and stroke to reset the color after stroking or filling.
+moved color into fill and stroke (accepts a string, identical to CSS)
+moved text drawing API's into defaults.
+add title and subtitle
+nice number formatting on numeric axes (not sure if toLocaleString is widely supported.)
+change font style to size, family instead of string
+added ratio to canvas preferred size.
+figure out what to do when one (or both) of the axes do not start at zero (implemented.)
+filtered minor ticks with major ticks removing duplicates
+calculate minimum and maximum canvas size correctly.
+changed text to support fill and stroke as well
+account for the aspect ratio when calculating the tick size.
+test vertical category axis (fixed, working now).
+add endPath and closePath and remove stroke and fill from path.
+remove itransform & itransform_length from graphics.
-server side support with Rhino and a simple implementation of Canvas
-drawing into canvas buffer and dynamically inserting an image through a data URL.
-test text drawing API on Firefox3.1
