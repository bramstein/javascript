-add legend
-test composite chart
-fix set bounds to include labels and axis labels
+implement canvas minimum size
+fixed preferred size to include axis label
+added axis label
+added option to viewport to switch to polar coordinates
+reimplemented crisp line drawing (more consistent, less code)
+added labels to numeric axes
+changed axis to accept a ticks object with either array or number parameters.
+implemented polar axes.
+added clipping to graphics
+added ellipse code to graphics
+added correct insets to canvas (might need some more work to save more screen space, but good enough for now)
+implemented preferred size for all components.
+changed canvas to only draw crisp lines
+reimplemented rect to draw crisp lines
+added line shape which draws crisp lines
+fixed ratio again (was slightly incorrect, hopefully got it right now)
+implemented insets for all components
+moved canvas beginViewport/endViewport outside of axes drawing code
+cleaned up canvas code a bit
+fixed category axis with numbers
+added colors from default to canvas
+fixed category axes with opposite axis not starting at zero (labels were hanging, which might be inconvenient).
+fixed long labels (all labels have equal size per axis, and the size is the maximum of the individual labels).
+fixed aspect ratio
+added draw grid options for canvas
+changed fill and stroke to reset the color after stroking or filling.
+moved color into fill and stroke (accepts a string, identical to CSS)
+moved text drawing API's into defaults.
+add title and subtitle
+nice number formatting on numeric axes (not sure if toLocaleString is widely supported.)
+change font style to size, family instead of string
+added ratio to canvas preferred size.
+figure out what to do when one (or both) of the axes do not start at zero (implemented.)
+filtered minor ticks with major ticks removing duplicates
+calculate minimum and maximum canvas size correctly.
+changed text to support fill and stroke as well
+account for the aspect ratio when calculating the tick size.
+test vertical category axis (fixed, working now).
+add endPath and closePath and remove stroke and fill from path.
+remove itransform & itransform_length from graphics.
-look into alternative text API's for IE and Opera
-look into vertical tick lengths again (slightly off, might be caused by rounding)
-look into SVG again (Rapheal library)
-server side support with Rhino and a simple implementation of Canvas
-drawing into canvas buffer and dynamically inserting an image through a data URL.
-test text drawing API on Firefox3.1
-reimplement simple vector and matrix library
