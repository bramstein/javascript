-move legend above chart instead of to the right if possible.
-custom axis settings as options parameter to charts (to override default settings easily)
+fixed order with reversed bar charts
+added function plotting chart type
+added support for stacked bar charts
+fixed sub category bar width and spacing
+added line chart
+added axis label(s)
+changed chart bounds to automatically lay out the chart upon setting its size
+moved graphics into chart
+added transpose option to bar chart (called reverse)
+added legend
+added optional linewidth parameter to stroke and fill methods
+made ticks a fixed length instead of dynamic
+added padding option to font options
+generalized chart
+made title and subtitle optional
+moved data range detection into data module
+added preference order to point shapes
+added drawing of polar data
+made title optional in scatter chart
+fixed bounds not taking padding into account
+added more shape primitives (cross, diamond, triangle, centered square)
+fixed circle radius
+changed category range to 1-n where n is the number of categories (simplifies rendering)
+added option to disable drawing of axis line
+added options to disable drawing of axis labels, ticks and grid
+cleaned up canvas options
+removed graphics from object constructor (now passed as parameter to the draw methods)
+added a fill color for data region/surrounding area
+cleaned up minimum and preferred size code
+added defaults fonts
+changed all font caluclations to use the new font metrics
+changed font size to use HTML font metrics (more reliable and accurate)
+fixed bounds to include labels
+implement canvas minimum size
+fixed preferred size to include axis label
+added axis label
+added option to viewport to switch to polar coordinates
+reimplemented crisp line drawing (more consistent, less code)
+added labels to numeric axes
+changed axis to accept a ticks object with either array or number parameters.
+implemented polar axes.
+added clipping to graphics
+added ellipse code to graphics
+added correct insets to canvas (might need some more work to save more screen space, but good enough for now)
+implemented preferred size for all components.
+changed canvas to only draw crisp lines
+reimplemented rect to draw crisp lines
+added line shape which draws crisp lines
+fixed ratio again (was slightly incorrect, hopefully got it right now)
+implemented insets for all components
+moved canvas beginViewport/endViewport outside of axes drawing code
+cleaned up canvas code a bit
+fixed category axis with numbers
+added colors from default to canvas
+fixed category axes with opposite axis not starting at zero (labels were hanging, which might be inconvenient).
+fixed long labels (all labels have equal size per axis, and the size is the maximum of the individual labels).
+fixed aspect ratio
+added draw grid options for canvas
+changed fill and stroke to reset the color after stroking or filling.
+moved color into fill and stroke (accepts a string, identical to CSS)
+moved text drawing API's into defaults.
+add title and subtitle
+nice number formatting on numeric axes (not sure if toLocaleString is widely supported.)
+change font style to size, family instead of string
+added ratio to canvas preferred size.
+figure out what to do when one (or both) of the axes do not start at zero (implemented.)
+filtered minor ticks with major ticks removing duplicates
+calculate minimum and maximum canvas size correctly.
+changed text to support fill and stroke as well
+account for the aspect ratio when calculating the tick size.
+test vertical category axis (fixed, working now).
+add endPath and closePath and remove stroke and fill from path.
+remove itransform & itransform_length from graphics.
-trend lines
-reference lines
-add support for highlighting data points
-perhaps move axes creation into chart (and add options to specify ticks)
-test composite chart
-add minimum size check to chart bounds
-try validation and range calculation based on input format specification
-more precise bounding box of data area using graphics (reduces border space, increases data area)
-implement circle with area parameter
-guarantee inclusion property for interval arithmetic (should fix data points lying exactly on a grid line, among other things)
-integrate font and alignment options so that font.size also includes the padding.
-option to draw the axes on the bottom and left of the chart instead of at the zero point
-line breaks in labels
-non-axis based grid
-look into SVG again (Rapheal library)
-server side support with Rhino and a simple implementation of Canvas
-drawing into canvas buffer and dynamically inserting an image through a data URL.
-test text drawing API on Firefox3.1
-implement div overlaying canvas for text drawing
-reimplement simple vector and matrix library
-add option to jLayout to support different coordinate systems.
-implement flow layout
