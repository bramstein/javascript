		<h1><span class="tex">T<sub>e</sub>X</span> line breaking algorithm in HTML5 Canvas</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">Bram Stein (<a href="http://www.bramstein.com/">http://www.bramstein.com</a> - <a href="mailto:b.l.stein@gmail.com">b.l.stein@gmail.com</a>)</p>

		<p>This is an implementation of the <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/113445055/abstract">Knuth and Plass line breaking algorithm</a> using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element. The goal of this implementation is to optimally set text in the new HTML5 canvas element, and ultimately implement a rich text editor using JavaScript and HTML5 features.</p>
		<p>The paragraph below is set using a (simplified) JavaScript implementation of the classic Knuth and Plass algorithm as used in <span class="tex">T<sub>e</sub>X</span>. The numbers on the right of each line are the stretching or shrinking ratio compared to the optimal line width. This example uses a default space of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> em width, with a stretchability and shrink-ability of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> em and <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>9</sub> em respectively.</p>
		<div class="example"><canvas id="justify" width="400" height="200"></canvas></div>
		<p>The following paragraph is set by your browser using <code>text-align: justify</code>. Notice the second and fifth line have greater inter-word spacing than the canvas version, which stretches the first line in order to minimize the inter-word spacing in later lines.</p>
		<div class="example"><div id="browser"></div></div>
		<p> The browser also ends up with ten lines instead of the nine found by the Knuth and Plass line breaking algorithm. This comparison might not be completely fair since we don't know the default inter-word space used by the browser (nor its stretching and shrinking parameters.) Experimental results however indicate the values used in Firefox are either identical or very similar. The next section explains how the values for your browser were calculated.</p>

		<h2>Measuring the quality of browser line breaks</h2>
		<p>Unfortunately there is no API to retrieve the positions of the line breaks the browser inserted so we'll have to resort to some trickery. By wrapping each word in an invisible <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element and retrieving its <code>y</code> position we can find out when a new line starts. If the <code>y</code> position of the current word is different from the previous word we know a new line has started. This way a paragraph is split up in several individual lines.</p>

		<p>The ratios are then calculated by measuring the difference between the width of each line when <code>text-align</code> is set to <code>justify</code> and when it is set to <code>right</code>. This difference is then divided by the amount of stretchability of the line: i.e. the number of spaces multiplied by the stretch parameter for spaces. Although we don't know the actual stretchability we can use <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub> em, just like the Knuth and Plass algorithm, if we only use it for comparison.</p>

		<h2>Assisted browser line breaks</h2>
		<p>The following paragraph is set according to the line breaks found by the Knuth and Plass algorithm, but instead of using the HTML5 Canvas element it is rendered by your browser. By adjusting the CSS <code>word-spacing</code> property we have achieved the same paragraph as in the Canvas example.</p>
		<div class="example"><div id="browser-assisted"></div></div>
		<p>Each line is wrapped in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element, with the same stretchability and shrink-ability values as in the Canvas example. These values are multiplied by the stretch or shrink ratio and used as the word spacing for that line.</p>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<h3>Ragged right and centered alignment</h3>
		<canvas id="left" width="350" height="220"></canvas>
		<canvas id="center" width="350" height="220"></canvas>
		<p>Ragged left text can be achieved by using a ragged left set text and aligning its endings with the left border.</p>
		<h3>Variable line width</h3>
		<p>Variable line width to flow text around illustrations, asides, quotes and the like.</p>

		<h2>To-do</h2>
		<p>The following are some extensions to the algorithm discussed in the original paper, which I intend to implement (at some point.)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hyphenation using <a href="http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/">Frank Liang's algorithm</a>. This will also improve the quality of the line breaks as it introduces more potential line breaks in a paragraph.</li>
			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_punctuation">Hanging punctuation</a>. A quote from the original Knuth and Plass paper explains how to implement it: 

				<blockquote>Some people prefer to have the right edge of their text look ‘solid’, by setting periods,
				commas, and other punctuation marks (including inserted hyphens) in the right-hand
				margin. For example, this practice is occasionally used in contemporary advertising.
				It is easy to get inserted hyphens into the margin: We simply let the width of the
				corresponding penalty item be zero. And it is almost as easy to do the same for periods
				and other symbols, by putting every such character in a box of width zero and adding
				the actual symbol width to the glue that follows. If no break occurs at this glue, the
				accumulated width is the same as before; and if a break does occur, the line will be
				justified as if the period or other symbol were not present.</blockquote>
			</li>
			<li>Test in other browsers: currently it seems to work fine with Firefox on Linux and Windows. Firefox on OSX, however performs badly (seems to be caused by strange font metrics, and bad anti-aliasing.) Also works fine with Safari on OSX.</li>
			<li>Compare quality against line-breaking implemented by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534671%28VS.85%29.aspx">Internet Explorer's <code>text-justify</code> CSS property</a>.</li>
			<li>Figure out how to deal with dynamic paragraphs (i.e. paragraphs being edited) as their ratios will change during editing and thus (if used with the Knuth and Plass linebreaking algorithm) visibly move around.</li>

Close by the king's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's child went out to the forest and sat down by the fountain; and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it; and this ball was her favorite plaything."
