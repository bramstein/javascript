Introduction

Design:
  - layout
      * component based
      * independent of chart
      * also able to lay out HTML elements
  - axis
      * generates "nice" axis labels (#ref)
      * accepts custom ticks, or calculated based on an interval
      * categoric axes
  - canvas
      * component
      * sets up viewport
      * draws axes depending on type
      * draws grid lines, labels
  - graphics
      * specialized chart API
      * performs all drawing in device pixel space
	  * forces crisp drawing
      * offers custom viewports
  - title
      * component
  - legend
      * component
  - chart
      * component (base class)
      * basic validation and restructuring of data

Chart types:
  - column/bar
  - scatter
  - line
  - histogram
  - function
  - small multiples

Other:
  - Web page integration (tables)
  - Interval arithmetic
  - Core
  - Pattern Matching
  - Color
      * quantitative vs. sequence vs. diverging
      * two sets: light hues & highlight colors
      * color brewer reference
  - Data format
      * single format for all chart types
      * category, time, variable

Future work:
  - SVG support
  - drawing graphics on the server side
  - more chart type support
  - match color sets based on supporting web page (find the closest match)
